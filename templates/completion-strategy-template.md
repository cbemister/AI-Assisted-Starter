- **Phase-based batching**: Generate documents by development phase
- **Methodology-based batching**: Generate documents by methodology focus
- **Priority-based batching**: Generate high-priority documents first
- **Dependency-based batching**: Generate prerequisite documents before dependent ones

### Quality Control at Scale
- **Template validation**: Automated checks for required sections and variables
- **Consistency verification**: Cross-document consistency validation
- **Methodology alignment**: Automated methodology compliance checking
- **Integration testing**: Validation of integration with feature-planning-template.md

## Cross-Project Reusability

### Project Type Adaptations

- **Healthcare**: HIPAA compliance, patient data security, clinical workflows
- **Financial Services**: Regulatory compliance, security standards, audit trails
- **Education**: Accessibility standards, learning management integration, student privacy

**Integration Points:**
- Works with templates/feature-planning-template.md
- Supports all three methodologies (user-centric, technology-innovation, business-value)
- Scales to 100+ feature planning documents
- Automation-friendly with variable placeholders

- Cross-project reusable with domain-specific adaptations

## Usage Instructions

### Step 1: Copy and Customize Template
```bash
# Copy the template to your project planning directory
cp templates/completion-strategy-template.md development/planning/COMPLETION-STRATEGY.md

# Or use the automated generation script
./workflows/generate-completion-strategy.sh --project-name "MyProject" --methodology "business-value"
```

### Step 2: Replace Template Variables
Replace all {{VARIABLE}} placeholders with project-specific values:

```markdown
# Example customization for an e-commerce project
{{PROJECT_NAME}} → "ShopFlow"
{{METHODOLOGY}} → "business-value"
{{PROJECT_DOMAIN}} → "e-commerce"
{{PROJECT_FOCUS}} → "online retail automation"
{{REMAINING_DOCUMENT_COUNT}} → "75"
{{PHASE_RANGE}} → "3-7"
{{STANDARD_DURATION}} → "45-60 minutes"
```

### Step 3: Customize Methodology-Specific Sections
Based on your selected methodology, complete the relevant sections:

- **User-Centric**: Focus on user research, accessibility, usability testing
- **Technology-Innovation**: Emphasize performance, technical excellence, innovation
- **Business-Value**: Highlight ROI, business metrics, stakeholder satisfaction

### Step 4: Define Phase-Specific Strategies
Customize the completion strategies for each phase based on your project's specific requirements and timeline.

### Step 5: Integrate with Feature Planning Template
Ensure the completion strategy aligns with your `templates/feature-planning-template.md` customizations for consistent document generation.
