   - What specific user pain points and frustrations exist?
   - How do these problems impact user task completion and satisfaction?
   - What accessibility barriers do users with disabilities face?
   - How frequently do users encounter these problems?

2. **User Impact Assessment**
   - Which users are most affected by these problems?
   - What is the severity of impact on user workflows and productivity?
   - How do these problems affect user emotional experience and satisfaction?
   - What workarounds do users currently employ?

3. **Accessibility and Inclusion Focus**
   - What accessibility compliance issues exist (WCAG 2.1 AA)?
   - How do these problems affect users with disabilities?
   - What assistive technology compatibility issues are present?
   - What inclusive design considerations are needed?

4. **User Validation Questions**
   - What questions should I ask users to validate these problems?
   - How can I measure the frequency and impact of these issues?
   - What user research methods would be most effective?
   - How can I test problem assumptions with real users?

**Output Format:**
- User-centered problem statement (from user perspective)
- User impact severity assessment (high/medium/low)
- Accessibility compliance gaps and requirements
- User validation plan with specific research methods
- Success criteria focused on user satisfaction and accessibility

Please prioritize user experience quality and accessibility compliance in your analysis.
