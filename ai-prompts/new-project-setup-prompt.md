### 4. Documentation Initialization
- Help me customize the AUGMENT_MEMORIES.txt file for my project
- Set up initial project documentation using the appropriate templates
- Create a project-specific README

### 5. Development Workflow Setup
- Configure the troubleshooting and knowledge management system for my project
- Set up progress tracking and context preservation workflows
- Establish AI assistant integration patterns

## Key Requirements
- Always reference existing patterns in /development/core-features/ before creating new implementations
- Use the template system in /templates/ for all documentation
- Follow the established troubleshooting workflow in /docs/
- Maintain consistency with the AI-Assisted-Starter methodology approach
- Set up proper knowledge management from the beginning

## Expected Deliverables
1. Methodology selection with rationale
2. Customized project structure and file organization
3. Technology stack configuration and setup instructions
4. Initialized documentation system with project-specific content
5. Development workflow and AI integration setup
6. Next steps roadmap for beginning development

Please start with methodology selection and work through each task systematically.
```

### ✅ Core Features Planning
- [ ] Reviewed `/development/core-features/` for applicable patterns
- [ ] Planned which core features your project will need
- [ ] Mapped core features to your chosen methodology approach
- [ ] Created initial feature development roadmap

## Ongoing Development Guidelines

### Always Reference Existing Patterns
Before implementing any new feature or solving any problem:
1. **Check `/development/core-features/`** for existing implementation patterns
2. **Review `/templates/troubleshooting/`** for similar issues and solutions
3. **Consult `/docs/knowledge/`** for lessons learned and prevention strategies
4. **Reference methodology-specific guidance** in `/methodologies/`

### Use the Template System
For all documentation and planning:
1. **Feature Planning**: Use `/templates/feature-planning-template.md`
2. **Progress Tracking**: Use `/templates/progress/` templates
3. **Issue Resolution**: Use `/templates/troubleshooting/` templates
4. **Knowledge Capture**: Use `/templates/knowledge/` templates

### Maintain AI Context
1. **Update project memories** regularly in `docs/AUGMENT_MEMORIES.txt`
2. **Use context preservation** templates for session handoffs
3. **Reference project context** in all AI assistant interactions
4. **Document decisions** and architectural choices for future AI sessions

### Follow Troubleshooting Protocols
1. **Create blocker files** immediately for issues taking >15 minutes
2. **Use systematic resolution** approaches from troubleshooting templates
3. **Document solutions** in resolved issues directory
4. **Extract lessons learned** and create prevention strategies

## Advanced Setup Options

### Multi-Methodology Approach
If your project benefits from multiple methodologies:
- **Primary Methodology**: 70% of decisions (main focus)
- **Secondary Methodology**: 30% of decisions (supporting focus)
- Document the combination rationale and application guidelines

### Framework-Specific Customizations
Based on your chosen technology stack:
- **React/Next.js**: Configure component architecture and state management patterns
- **Vue/Nuxt.js**: Set up composition API and module organization
- **Angular**: Configure dependency injection and service architecture
- **Vanilla JS**: Set up module system and build tool configuration

### Enterprise/Team Adaptations
For larger projects or teams:
- Set up collaborative documentation workflows
- Configure team-specific troubleshooting and knowledge sharing
- Establish code review and quality assurance processes
- Create team onboarding and context sharing procedures

## Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

### Methodology Selection Uncertainty
**Problem**: Unsure which methodology to choose
**Solution**: 
1. Use the decision tree in `/workflows/methodology-decision-tree.md`
2. Consider your primary success criteria and constraints
3. Start with one methodology and adjust based on early feedback

### Technology Stack Conflicts
**Problem**: Chosen technologies don't integrate well with AI-Assisted-Starter patterns
**Solution**:
1. Review `/development/core-features/` for framework-specific guidance
2. Adapt patterns to your technology choices rather than changing technologies
3. Document adaptations for future reference

### Documentation Overwhelm
**Problem**: Too many templates and documentation requirements
**Solution**:
1. Start with essential templates only (project memories, basic progress tracking)
2. Add documentation incrementally as project grows
3. Focus on templates that directly support your chosen methodology

### AI Integration Difficulties
**Problem**: AI assistant not providing consistent or helpful responses
**Solution**:
1. Ensure project context is properly documented in `docs/AUGMENT_MEMORIES.txt`
2. Use the context injection prompts from `/ai-prompts/context-preservation/`
3. Reference specific project patterns and constraints in AI interactions

## Success Validation

Your setup is complete when:
- [ ] You can start development immediately using established patterns
- [ ] AI assistant provides consistent, project-aware assistance
- [ ] Documentation system captures progress and decisions automatically
- [ ] Troubleshooting workflows are ready for immediate use
- [ ] Core feature development can begin using existing patterns and templates

## Next Steps After Setup

1. **Begin Feature Development**: Start with core features using patterns from `/development/core-features/`
2. **Establish Development Rhythm**: Use progress tracking and context preservation workflows
3. **Build Knowledge Base**: Document learnings and solutions as you develop
4. **Iterate on Methodology**: Adjust approach based on early development experience
5. **Maintain AI Context**: Keep project memories and documentation current for effective AI assistance
