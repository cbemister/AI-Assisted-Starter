# AI-Assisted Solo Development Starter Template

**Project Nature**: This is a comprehensive **project methodology toolkit** that developers copy in its entirety to bootstrap new development projects. This is not a software application to be developed, but rather a complete development framework containing templates, workflows, scripts, and documentation.

**Purpose**: When you run `cp -r ai-assisted-starter/ my-new-project/` or use the setup scripts like `setup-dual-environments.bat`, you receive a complete development methodology system including:
- Workflow scripts for methodology selection and PRD generation
- Template files for documentation, troubleshooting, and decision-making
- AI prompt libraries organized by development phase and methodology
- Methodology-specific guidance modules
- Development best practices and troubleshooting frameworks

## 📋 Prerequisites

### Required Software
- **Git**: For version control and repository management
- **Bash/Shell**: For running workflow scripts (Linux/macOS/WSL)
- **Windows**: PowerShell for batch scripts (Windows users)
- **Text Editor**: For editing Markdown files and templates
- **AI Assistant**: ChatGPT, Claude, or similar for AI-assisted development

### System Requirements
- **Operating System**: Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **Disk Space**: ~50MB for template files
- **Internet**: For cloning repositories and AI assistant access

## 🚀 Quick Start (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Copy the Complete Toolkit
```bash
# Option A: Clone the entire toolkit for a new project
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/ai-assisted-starter.git my-new-project
cd my-new-project/

# Option B: Copy existing toolkit to new project
cp -r ai-assisted-starter/ my-new-project/
cd my-new-project/

```

## 🎯 Methodology Selection Decision Tree

### Primary Goal Assessment
**Question 1**: What is your primary success criteria?
- **User satisfaction and accessibility** → User-Centric
- **Technical performance and innovation** → Technology-Innovation  
- **Business outcomes and ROI** → Business-Value

**Question 2**: What type of application are you building?
- **Consumer-facing, user experience critical** → User-Centric
- **Technical product, performance critical** → Technology-Innovation
- **Business tool, efficiency focused** → Business-Value

**Question 3**: What is your main competitive advantage?
- **Superior user experience** → User-Centric
- **Technical capabilities** → Technology-Innovation
- **Business value delivery** → Business-Value

### Methodology Combinations
You can also combine methodologies for different phases:
- **Primary methodology**: 70% of decisions
- **Secondary methodology**: 30% of decisions

Example: User-Centric primary with Technology-Innovation secondary for performance-critical user applications.
