    return ((returns - investment) / investment) * 100;
  },
  
  // Market Opportunity Assessment
  marketOpportunity: {
    totalAddressableMarket: {{TAM_VALUE}},
    serviceableMarket: {{SAM_VALUE}},
    targetMarketShare: {{TARGET_SHARE_PERCENTAGE}}
  },
  
  // Cost-Benefit Analysis
  costBenefit: {
    developmentCost: {{DEVELOPMENT_COST}},
    maintenanceCost: {{MAINTENANCE_COST}},
    opportunityCost: {{OPPORTUNITY_COST}}
  }
};
```

#### KPI Tracking Organization
- **Financial KPIs**: Revenue, profit margins, cost reduction, ROI measurement
- **Market KPIs**: Market share, competitive positioning, customer acquisition

    optimizationTargets: ['{{CONVERSION_TARGET_1}}', '{{CONVERSION_TARGET_2}}']
  },
  
  customerValue: {
    lifetimeValueCalculation: true,
    segmentationStrategy: '{{SEGMENTATION_APPROACH}}',
    retentionOptimization: true
  }
};
```

#### Market Intelligence Integration
