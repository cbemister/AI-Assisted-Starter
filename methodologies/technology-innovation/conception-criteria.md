## Weighted Scoring Calculation

### Formula
```
Total Score = (Innovation Potential × 0.40) + (Technical Feasibility × 0.25) + (Performance × 0.20) + (Future-Proofing × 0.15)
```

### Decision Thresholds
- **Proceed (8.0+)**: Strong technical innovation case for development
- **Consider (6.0-7.9)**: Moderate case requiring additional technical validation
- **Revise (4.0-5.9)**: Weak case requiring significant technical refinement
- **Reject (< 4.0)**: Insufficient technical innovation justification
