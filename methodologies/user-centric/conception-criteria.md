# User-Centric Evaluation Criteria

## Primary Evaluation Framework

### 1. User Impact Severity (40%)
**Focus**: How significantly does this problem affect users?

#### Evaluation Questions
- What is the frequency and intensity of user pain caused by this problem?
- How many users are affected by this problem daily/weekly?
- What is the severity of impact on user task completion?
- How does this problem affect user satisfaction and experience?

#### Scoring Criteria
- **High (9-10)**: Critical user pain affecting majority of users daily
- **Medium (6-8)**: Moderate user pain affecting some users regularly
- **Low (3-5)**: Minor user inconvenience affecting few users occasionally
- **Minimal (1-2)**: Negligible user impact with rare occurrence

#### Validation Methods
- User interview feedback and pain point frequency
- User behavior analytics showing task abandonment
- Support ticket volume and user complaint analysis
- User satisfaction survey results and ratings

### 2. User Validation Strength (25%)
**Focus**: How consistently do users report and validate this problem?

#### Evaluation Questions
- How consistently do users report this problem across interviews?
- What evidence supports the problem definition from user behavior?
- How do users currently work around this problem?
- What validation exists from user testing and feedback?

#### Scoring Criteria
- **High (9-10)**: Unanimous user validation with strong behavioral evidence
- **Medium (6-8)**: Majority user validation with some behavioral evidence
- **Low (3-5)**: Mixed user validation with limited evidence
- **Minimal (1-2)**: Weak user validation with little supporting evidence

#### Validation Methods
- User interview consistency analysis
- User behavior data correlation
- User testing and prototype feedback
- User survey and feedback form responses

### 3. User Adoption Potential (20%)
**Focus**: How motivated are users to adopt solutions for this problem?

#### Evaluation Questions
- How motivated are users to solve this problem?
- What barriers exist to user adoption of new solutions?
- How does this align with user mental models and expectations?
- What is the user learning curve for potential solutions?

#### Scoring Criteria
- **High (9-10)**: Strong user motivation with minimal adoption barriers
- **Medium (6-8)**: Moderate user motivation with some adoption barriers
- **Low (3-5)**: Limited user motivation with significant adoption barriers
- **Minimal (1-2)**: Weak user motivation with major adoption barriers

#### Validation Methods
- User motivation and willingness assessment
- User mental model alignment testing
- User adoption barrier identification
- User learning curve and comprehension testing

### 4. Accessibility and Inclusion (15%)
**Focus**: How does this problem affect users with disabilities and diverse needs?

#### Evaluation Questions
- How does this problem affect users with disabilities?
- What inclusive design considerations are needed for solutions?
- How can solutions serve diverse user needs and abilities?
- What accessibility compliance requirements apply?

#### Scoring Criteria
- **High (9-10)**: Critical accessibility impact requiring immediate attention
- **Medium (6-8)**: Moderate accessibility impact with clear improvement needs
- **Low (3-5)**: Minor accessibility impact with enhancement opportunities
- **Minimal (1-2)**: Minimal accessibility impact with basic compliance needs

#### Validation Methods
- Accessibility testing with assistive technology users
- WCAG compliance assessment and gap analysis
- Inclusive design evaluation and user feedback
- Accessibility expert review and validation

## Weighted Scoring Calculation

### Formula
```
Total Score = (User Impact × 0.40) + (User Validation × 0.25) + (User Adoption × 0.20) + (Accessibility × 0.15)
```

### Decision Thresholds
- **Proceed (8.0+)**: Strong user-centered case for development
- **Consider (6.0-7.9)**: Moderate case requiring additional validation
- **Revise (4.0-5.9)**: Weak case requiring significant problem refinement
- **Reject (< 4.0)**: Insufficient user-centered justification
