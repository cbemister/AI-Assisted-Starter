  - Develop 2-3 primary personas with demographics, goals, and behaviors
  - Include accessibility needs and assistive technology usage
  - Document user mental models and expectations

- [ ] **Map current user journeys** and identify friction points
  - Document step-by-step user workflows for key tasks
  - Identify pain points, confusion, and abandonment points
  - Note accessibility barriers and usability issues

- [ ] **Research accessibility requirements** and inclusive design needs

  - Research assistive technology compatibility requirements
  - Document diverse user needs and accommodation requirements

### Deliverables
- User interview transcripts and insights summary
- User persona profiles with accessibility considerations
- Current state user journey maps with friction points
- Accessibility requirements and compliance checklist

## Phase 2: User-Centered Problem Definition (Days 4-5)

### Core Activities
- [ ] **Define user problems using user language** and context
  - Write problem statements from user perspective
  - Use actual user quotes and terminology
  - Focus on user impact rather than technical issues

- [ ] **Validate problem statements with target users**
  - Present problem definitions to users for confirmation
  - Gather feedback on problem priority and impact
  - Refine problem statements based on user input

- [ ] **Prioritize problems based on user impact** and frequency
  - Rank problems by severity of user pain and frequency
  - Consider accessibility impact and inclusive design needs
  - Focus on problems affecting the most users most severely

- [ ] **Assess user willingness to adopt solutions**
  - Understand user motivation to change current behavior
  - Identify barriers to user adoption of new solutions
  - Evaluate user mental model alignment with potential solutions

### Deliverables
- User-validated problem statements
- Problem prioritization matrix based on user impact
- User adoption readiness assessment

## Phase 3: User-Validated Solution Exploration (Days 6-8)

### Core Activities
- [ ] **Generate solution concepts based on user mental models**
  - Design solutions that align with user expectations
  - Use familiar patterns and interaction paradigms
  - Ensure solutions match user workflow preferences

- [ ] **Create user-centered solution prototypes** and mockups
  - Build low-fidelity prototypes for user testing
  - Focus on user task flow and interaction design
  - Include accessibility features from the beginning

- [ ] **Test solution concepts with target users**
  - Conduct usability testing sessions with prototypes
  - Test with users who use assistive technology
  - Gather feedback on comprehension and usability

- [ ] **Validate accessibility compliance** of proposed solutions
  - Test with screen readers and keyboard navigation
